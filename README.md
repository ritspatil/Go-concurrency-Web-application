# Go-concurrency-Web-application

 
Create an application in Go (golang.org) that does a simple GET request on a list of sites.  The program should read the list of URLs (one per line) from stdin and write the URLs with their content to stdout.  For example, with the input:
 
  http://google.com
  http://yahoo.com
  http://ebay.com
 
The program should print out (in no particular order):
 
  http://yahoo.com:
  <Yahoo!'s content>
  http://ebay.com:
  <eBay's content>
  http://google.com:
  <Google's content>
